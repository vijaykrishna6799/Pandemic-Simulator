# Pandemic-Simulator
Implemented SIR and SIRS model in Python

# For complete Explaination go to the Pdf Document

Total Population Considered for Simulation : 1000




SIR and SIRS model is implemented and the outputs are observed for various Alpha, Beta and Gamma values.
Simulation is also observed when a vaccination is in effect for the population and also the model behaviour when we have more activity (movement) in the population.
Simulation is done for a period of 2000 days on 1000 population
